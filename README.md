# 3D Volumetric Defect Detection in Additive Manufacturing

This project was completed as my master’s thesis in the [Master’s in Statistics and Machine Learning program](https://liu.se/en/education/program/f7mml) at Linköping University.  
This thesis was carried out in collaboration with [Interspectral](https://interspectral.com/), a company specializing in advanced data visualization solutions for the Additive Manufacturing industry. 

## Abstract
Additive manufacturing, commonly referred to as 3D printing, is transforming modern production by enabling the manufacturing of complex geometries with reduced material waste. However, the presence of anomalies during the build process remains a significant challenge, often affecting part quality and leading to production inefficiencies. This thesis investigates the use of 3D volume-based object detection techniques to identify defects within powder bed images. By treating image stacks as 3D volumes, this approach captures both spatial and temporal patterns, providing a richer representation of the build process. Machine learning and deep learning methods are implemented and evaluated to detect and localize defects using 3D bounding boxes. Overall, traditional machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost outperformed deep learning architectures like ResNet in this study. Among the deep learning models, those pretrained on Med3D, a dataset from the closely related field of medical imaging, performed better than models trained from scratch or pretrained on unrelated data such as Kinetics-400. This suggests that transfer learning from domains with similar data characteristics can improve the performance. However, even the best-performing deep learning model lagged behind traditional methods, likely due to the relatively simple structure of the powder bed images. These results suggest that traditional models leveraging statistical features remain more effective in scenarios with low visual complexity.
